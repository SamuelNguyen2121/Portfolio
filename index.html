            I am a third year computer science student at Champlain College in Saint-Lambert. I also currently work at Costco
            Wholesale in Brossard since 2021 as an assistant cashier. My main interests in life are traveling, sports, cars and
            music, but I am still open to other things.

            I am a perseverant person who always seeks to do a better job by improving myself with feedback from my
            surroundings. For example, I have the ability to adapt myself to different work envrionments. The transition from 
            high school to Cegep made me to develop the adaptive skill because courses became more challenging. Also, I believe
            that my perseverance side of my personality will play an important role in developing my personal skills. During my
            summer job for the past few years at Costco, customer service being the main job helped me develop and improve my 
            communication skills and learning to be patient. On top of that, when I was assigned individual tasks, I learned 
            to work autonomously but at the same time in team when other people needed help. Also, switching departments 
            during my years at Costco helped me to evolve my adaptive skill.
